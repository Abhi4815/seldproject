                <h2>GEL</h2><br>
                <h4>The Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel is proof that when it comes to skincare, better-for-you doesn’t have to be expensive. If this glassy aqua blue gel doesn’t have you at hello, the triple-threat of Hyaluronic Acid, Dimethicone, Glycerin and the Nykaa Femina Beauty Awards stamp of approval will surely seal the deal. With this cool (in both senses of the word) over-the-counter tub, you won't even be tempted to use an Instagram filter.</h4>

                <h2>RICE, RICE BABY!</h2><br>
                <h4>There’s a reason why The Face Shop Rice Water Bright Foaming Cleanser sells faster than you can double cleanse. This rice-themed solution is a rich, dense foam that promises to gently cleanse, moisturize and even brighten your complexion. This top-rated hero melts away makeup while keeping skin ultra-hydrated. Got sensitive skin? Well, today is your lucky day. If your skin turns red at the thought of washing your face, this Korean cleanser will wash all the impurities and your fears away.</h4>

                <h2>THE MASK TASK</h2><br>
                <h4>Due to this global pandemic, we’ve unfortunately reached a point where we need masks to ensure that you stay safe and healthy during this unprecedented period. That said, we brought in the Gubb USA Protection 3-Ply Surgical Masks to slow the spread of COVID-19. Each protective layer is splash resistant and reduces the risk of contamination. After using the mask, it’s important that you wrap it in a tissue or a plastic bag and put it in a receptacle, ideally one with a lid. We suggest you order your set of this breakthrough beauty product today to be on the safe side.</h4>

                <h2>LIP TIP</h2><br>
                <h4>Recently, we've noticed an influx of options hitting the market made specifically for lip health. However, there was one berry tinted elixir in particular, that instantly caught our attention. Ah, the LANEIGE Lip Sleeping Mask Berry.  Fortified with Raspberry, Blueberry, and Cranberry extracts, its fresh berry like scent sends it over the edge. If you pride yourself in having pillow-soft, kissable lips, this tub will do you justice.  Leave it on while you snooze and let the formula do all the work, because this mask means business.</h4>
